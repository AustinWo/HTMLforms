HTMLforms
=========

In my journey of learning to code, I created a sign-up form with HTML following TreeHouse video and code tutorial.

Create a simple sign-up form for an imaginary web app, Form wont submit anywhere since that requires additional server-side code.

Basic CSS styling was provided by TreeHouse.
